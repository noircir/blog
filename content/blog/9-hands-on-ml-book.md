### Chapter 1 
Good general overview of machine learning.

### Chapter 2
End-to-end project: California housing prices' model and price prediction. 

Breaks down RMSE and MAE well, for a person with a rusty math.

Creating virtualenv (separate for each project) is well explained. For those with Anaconda project managment tool installed, the process is a bit different. See my post on creating a virtualenv with conda in "Today I learned".
