Frustrated (for the Nth time) with Bash rejecting some commands on Mac, ("-bash: command XXX doesn't exist"), this time, the virtualenv command.... And the suggestions on the web always revolve arouth $PATH, .bash-profile, .bashrc... which doesn't seem to make any difference...

So thankful to have found this tiny answer (4th on this page) that if Anaconda package manager is installed , it basically takes over the virtual environment management.
